Cloudways: 跟读者分享一些你的故事吧，你是如何开始你的开发生涯的，是谁促动了你，还有截止现在你觉得自己做的最好的工作是什么？

Alexander: 读者们好！我是 Alexander Makarov 一名来自俄罗斯的 IT 工程师，大部分工作就是 Yii 框架和参与 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.php-fig.org/">PHP-FIG</a>，最近，我全职在 <a href="http://www.stay.com/beijing/guides/" target="_blank">stay.com</a> 上班，只能用我的空闲时间来维护 Yii，你可能在 Github 上见过我 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samdark">@samdark</a>。

当我还是个孩子的时候，我的父亲配置了一台 z80 的电脑，里面运行着 sinclair basic (BASIC 的编程方言)，当然还有游戏。玩游戏玩够了之后，我开始思考它们是怎么工作的，这些游戏是如何运转的。我喜欢自己明白的那种感觉，所以它决定了我需要正确地学习计算机科学。五年在大学获得了硕士学位，让我得到了一份在西门子做 DBA 和 Java/SAP 的工作，在那之后又过了 10 年，自从大学起我就使用 PHP 来做个人项目，因为它比 J2EE 在开发简单的 web 上更合适。

最开始 PHP 还是简单的，后来我使用了 CodeIgniter，很快发现它存在着许多的限制，之后搜索了许多完美的框架，试用了 CakePHP、Zend 和其它的，无意中打开了 Yii 官网（当时还很丑），查看了它的文档。它做地非常地合理，试用完 Yii 后，我发现它运行速度非常地快，并且很好地平衡了复杂难懂和简单的操作，让我的工作流程更舒适。2010 年我加入了 Yii 团队一直到现在，它是我做的最值得关注的开源工作。

Cloudways: 你在 stay.com 主要负责哪些工作？

Alexander: 主要负责开发网站、CMS 和 API，当 Android、服务器、SOLR 需要时，我会去帮忙。

Cloudways: Alexander 你是 Zend 认证的开发者，你为什么会选择 Yii 而不是 Zend 呢？你是如何对比它们的？

Alexander: 我是 ZCE (Zend Certified Developer) 没错，但是你可能把这个证书和 Zend 框架弄混了，ZCE 只是关于PHP 自身的。

Despite that, I’m familiar with Zend framework, so I can answer second part of the question. At the time when I was choosing a framework, there was the first version of Zend Framework. The way it was built was too formal for me. Everything according to RFCs, pattern books etc. While it was theoretically coded the best possible way, in reality it was a bit overcomplicated. Moreover, there were deviations from RFCs (I remember ones about email component) which Zend team refused to include patches for.

On the other hand, Yii was all about practice. If, in practice, there was deviation from RFCs, framework was patched accordingly to function well in a real environment. Also, it was much faster than Zend and had nicer syntax, making everyday coding more pleasant.

Cloudways: You are one of the core contributors of one of the top PHP framework Yii. How do you feel about it?

Alexander: Mostly good. It’s a great feeling when you realize that you’re creating something other developers are using for their daily jobs. When there are contributions, you really feel the community spirit. Also, I love digging into coding quirks and developing a framework gives me lots of opportunity to do that.

Of course, there are not so good parts. Maintaining such a big open source project drains your time like crazy. Sometimes, there are rude people demanding things fixed immediately etc. But overall, I think, there are more good parts than bad parts.

Cloudways: What are your main contributions in Yii Framework. Which version of Yii have you worked on the most?

Alexander: Since I came to Yii having background in J2EE, CodeIgniter and some experience with other frameworks, in 1.1 time I was mainly contributing good features that were there during my past experience but were missing in Yii. Yii 2.0 is another story. I’ve participated in it from the very beginning of the project, designing it together with Qiang Xue and Yii core team members.

Cloudways: According to a 2015 survey by sitepoint, Laravel tops the list of the most used framework, and Yii2 stands on the 4th position. Do you think Yii2 can get the top position in future?

There’s a chance, but I don’t think Yii will be at the top of the list in the US next year. It’s hard to compete in marketing with local US commercial players. Yii is slightly more popular outside US. Especially in Russia, Ukraine and ex-USSR countries which are easily reachable for conferences.

Cloudways: How would you compare Yii with Laravel and Symfony?

Alexander: All three are good frameworks with their own pros and cons.

Laravel has excellent marketing, good public API, lots of cool infrastructure, good events in US. Until recently, it wasn’t really suitable for lengthy projects because new major versions were released one after another and old ones were just dropped. Now it’s much better. The framework management and development is a bit fragile since it depends a lot on its founder but, hopefully, it will change with time.

Symfony has a very long history. It’s mature and is backed by a strong company which could affoink Yii2 can documentatince, but I don’t think Yii will be at the top of the listron the US next year.

Symfony has a very long history. It’s mature and is backed by a strong company which could afford full time documentation team, and developers team. The framework community is strong as well. The framework leans slightly towards enterprise solutions and is suitable for really complicated applications. Because of that, some parts of the framework are really complex.

Yii is all about practice. It’s very fast to develop prototypes with, because of Gii code generator and well-made enhanced implementation of ActiveRecord design pattern. Yii provides lots of features out of the box. The community is strong, docs are good, code is stable and we care about backwards compatibility. We cut lots of edges for a reason. As a result, Yii performs better than Laravel or Symfony using the same hardware with the similar application implemented. As for downsides, Yii doesn’t stand in your way much when you’re trying to go against best practices, clean code and domain driven design. Still, if you know what you’re doing, all the tools are there for you.

Cloudways: What are the best features of Yii according to you?

Alexander: Error handling and debug toolbar, code generation, forms, query builder and active record, data providers and data widgets, strong i18n layer, REST API framework.

Cloudways: Alexander, what are your activities when you are not working at all? How do you spend your time?

Alexander: Traveling, bicycling, watching movies, playing games, doing various family activities.

Cloudways: Just for our readers, can you send a picture of your workstation?

Alexander: Here you go!

Cloudways: What advice would you like to give to students who are going to start their career as a developer?

Alexander: Spend time to learn computer science fundamentals. You won’t need it in the first five years, but later there will be no way to get further without a good base and it will make a big difference.

Cloudways: We at Cloudways are providing one click installation for PHP stack and different PHP frameworks. I would like you to check it yourself and share your opinion about the platform. What can we do to further improve the outlook and performance of the platform?

Alexander: Overall, the service is fine. It may save time on setting up everything from scratch. Pricing is reasonable especially for lower tiers. There are downsides, of course:

The default stack is made to meet the needs of many different developers so while it’s OK, custom stack may perform much better.
Some DigitalOcean features aren’t available yet.
As for Yii, all the requirements for Yii 2.0 are OK so it should work fine.
